         <p>Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality Lab has been established in the year of 2016 under FTE, CHARUSAT for giving exposure of AR/VR development to the university students. This lab is equipped with 14 Zspace PCs, which is compatible to simulate desktop VR applications.
            In the 21st century, technology is taking over education be it skill-building programmers in universities, real-world technical training and learning of abstract concepts in schools. The shift from conventional means to experiential methods of transacting learning has seen new-age technologies like augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality a combination of AR/VR — have been playing a key role in driving learning and edtech engagement.
